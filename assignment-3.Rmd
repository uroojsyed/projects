## Sample Question and Solution

Use `seq()` to create the vector $(2,4,6,\ldots,20)$.

```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE.
seq(2,20,by = 2)

```
## Question 1 [15 Pts]

a) [5 Pts] First and second midterm grades of some students are given as c(85,76,78,88,90,95,42,31) and c(55,76,48,58,80,75,32,22). Set R variables `first` and `second` respectively. Then find the least-squares line relating the second midterm to the first midterm. 

   Does the assumption of a linear relationship appear to be reasonable in this case? Give reasons to your answer as a comment.
```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE
first <- c(85,76,78,88,90,95,42,31)
second <- c(55,76,48,58,80,75,32,22)

relation_model <- lm(second ~ first)
summary(relation_model)
```


```{r}
# The relation appears to be linear in this case as the median is close to 0 and the coefficient of determination R-squared is close to +1.
```

b) [5 Pts] Plot the second midterm as a function of the first midterm using a scatterplot and graph the least-square line on the same plot. 
```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE

# Using the intercept and slope of the linear model
plot(first, second, pch=1,
xlab="first midterm",
ylab="second midterm",
main="scores of second midterm vs. first midterm")
abline(-1.1669, 0.7784, col="red")
```

c) [5 Pts] Use the regression line to predict the second midterm grade when the first midterm grade is 88. 
```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE

# Using the coefficients from the linear model
predict_grade <- -1.1669 + 0.7784  * 88
predict_grade
```



## Question 2 [45 Pts]

This question makes use of package "plm". Please load Crime dataset as follows:
```{r load_packages}
# or install.packages("plm")
library(plm) 
data(Crime)
```

a) [5 Pts] Display the first 10 rows of 'crime' data and display the names of all the variables, then display a descriptive summary of each variable. 
```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE
head(Crime, n=10)
```
```{r}
names(Crime)
```


```{r}
summary(Crime)
```


b) [5 Pts] Calculate the mean,variance and standard deviation of tax revenue per capita (taxpc) by omitting the missing values, if any. 
```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE
mean(na.omit(Crime$taxpc))
```


```{r}
var(na.omit(Crime$taxpc))
```


```{r}
sd(na.omit(Crime$taxpc))
```

c) [5 Pts] Use `density` and `smsa` variables to build a linear regression model to predict tax per capita (taxpc).  

   [5 Pts] How can you draw a conclusion from the result? 
```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE
per_capita_model <- lm(Crime$taxpc ~ Crime$density + Crime$smsa, data = Crime)
summary(per_capita_model)
```


```{r}
# The coefficient of determination R-squared is closer to 0 at 0.06 or 6% which means that density and smsa have a weak positive correlation with taxpc. The intercept is equal to 29.5 and the coefficients for 'density' is -0.2345 and 11.2808 when the value of 'smsa' is 'yes'. Therefore, as density of people per square mile goes up, the tax revenue per capita goes down. 
```

d) [5 Pts] Based on the output of your model, write the equations using the intercept and factors of `smsa` when `density` is set to 2.4. and compare the result with `predict()` function.  
Hint: Explore `predict()` function
```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE

# Using the coefficients from the linear model
predict_no <- 29.5615 + -0.2345*(2.4)
predict_no
```


```{r}
predict_yes <- 29.5615 + -0.2345*(2.4) + 11.2808
predict_yes
```

```{r}
predict_smsa_df <- data.frame(Crime$density, Crime$smsa)
predict_smsa <- predict(per_capita_model, predict_smsa_df)
mean(predict_smsa[Crime$smsa == 'no'])
```
```{r}
mean(predict_smsa[Crime$smsa == 'yes'])
```


```{r}
# The results are very similar with a difference of ~+/-1
```

e) [5 Pts] Find Pearson correlation between `density` and tax per capita `taxpc`; between density and police per capita `polpc`. 

   [5 Pts] What conclusions can you draw? Write your reasons as comments.
```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE
cor(Crime$density, Crime$taxpc, method = "pearson")
```
```{r}
cor(Crime$density, Crime$polpc, method = "pearson")
```


```{r}
# The correlation coefficient is positive for 'density' and 'taxpc' meaning that there is a positive relationship between the two variables. However, it is only 19% so the correlation is weak. The correlation coefficient is negative for 'density' and 'polpc' so there is a negative linear correlation between these two variables. This shows us that the number of police officers per person will decrease as the density of people per capita increases.
```

f) [5 Pts] Display the correlation matrix of the variables: avgsen, polpc, density, taxpc. 

   [5 Pts]  Write what conclusion you can draw, as comments.
```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE
cor(Crime[c("avgsen", "polpc", "density", "taxpc")])
```


```{r}
# Most of the variables have a positive correlation with each other. The only negative correlation is 'polpc' and 'density'. As stated above, it makes sense to be a negative correlation here because as density increases, the number of police officers will be less in relation.
```



## Question 3 [15 Pts]

This question makes use of package "ISwR". Please load `airquality` dataset as following:

```{r}
# or install.packages("ISwR")
library(ISwR) 
data(airquality)
str(airquality)
```


a) [5 Pts] Use a histogram to assess the normality of the `Ozone` variable, then explain why it does not appear normally distributed. 
```{r}
#attach(airquality)

#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE
summary(airquality)
hist(airquality$Ozone)
```


```{r}
# We can see that the histogram has a positive skew (right-skewed). It does not have a symmetrical distribution because according to the summary of the data, the mean is 42.13 which is greater than the median 31.50.
```

b) [5 Pts] Create a boxplot that shows the distribution of `Ozone` in each month. Use different colors for each month. 

```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE
boxplot(Ozone ~ Month, data = airquality, main = "distribution of ozone per month", 
xlab="number of month", 
ylab="ozone", col = c('pink', 'blue', 'purple', 'yellow', 'green'))

```
c) [5 Pts] Create a matrix of scatterplots of all the numeric variables in the `airquality` dataset (i.e. Ozone, Solar.R, Wind and Temp.)
(Hint: investigate pairs() function) 

```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE
vars <- c("Ozone", "Solar.R", "Wind", "Temp")
pairs(airquality[vars])
```
## Question 4 [25 Pts]

$\pi$ appears in the formula for the standard normal distribution, the most important probability distribution in statistics. Why not give it a try to calculate $\pi$ using statistics! In fact, you'll use a simulation technique called the *Monte Carlo Method*.

Recall that the area of a circle of radius $r$ is $A = \pi r^2$. Therefore the area of a circle of radius 1, aka a *unit circle*, is $\pi$. You'll compute an approximation to the area of this circle using the Monte Carlo Method.

a) [5 Pts] The Monte Carlo Method uses random numbers to simulate some process. Here the process is throwing darts at a square. Assume the darts are uniformly distributed over the square. Imagine a unit circle enclosed by a square whose sides are of length 2. Set an R variable `area.square` to be the area of a square whose sides are of length 2. 
```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE
area.square = 2^2
```

b) [5 Pts] The points of the square can be given x-y coordinates. Let both x and y range from -1 to +1 so that the square is centred on the origin of the coordinate system. Throw some darts at the square by generating random numeric vectors x and y, each of length `N = 10,000`. Set R variables `x` and `y` each to be uniformly distributed random numbers in the range -1 to +1. 
(hint: runif() generates random number for the uniform distribution) 
```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE
x <- runif(10000, -1)
y <- runif(10000, -1)
```

c) [10 Pts] Now count how many darts landed inside the unit circle. Recall that a point is inside the unit circle when $x^2 + y^2 < 1$. Save the result of successful hits in a variable named hit. 
(hint: a for loop over the length of x and y is one option to reach hit) 
```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE
hits <- function(x)
{
  for (i in 1:length(x)) {
    if (x[i]^2 + y[i]^2 < 1) hits = hits + 1 }
}
```

d) [5 Pts] The probability that a dart hits inside the circle is proportional to the ratio of the area of the circle to the area of the square. Use this fact to calculate an approximation to $\pi$ and print the result. 
```{r}
#INSERT YOUR ANSWER HERE
```
Wow you got the first estimate for `pi` $\pi$ at least accurate to first decimal place by this simple logic! Congratulations! you have completed the first run of the Monte Carlo simulation. 

If there is further interest, put all the above logic in a function, and call it 50 times at least, and store the results in a vector called pi then take the mean of pi vector to be more accurate.
